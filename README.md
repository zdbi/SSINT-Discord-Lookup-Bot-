# SSINT 

SSINT was a lookup tool to find more about a person from certain information you may have obtained, I was the main developer for the project but the owner decided to take my work and not pay me, this is part of the bot which i believe releasing publicly won't cause any harm, and might inspire other people to create interesting projects with discord bots.

```bash
pip install discord
pip install requests
pip install bs4
pip install ipinfo
pip install sqlite3
